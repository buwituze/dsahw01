2) For each input file in the sample folder, output a result file which contains a
list of the unique integers in this file. For example, for input file “sample_input_02.txt”,
the results are in sample_results/sample_input_02.txt_results.txt

3) The integers in result file are sorted in increasing order.

4) If any digits appear multiple times in the input, they are printed only once.
